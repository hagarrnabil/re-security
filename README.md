# **REAL ESTATE SPRING BOOT APPLICATION WITH AUTHENTICATION**

## This is a real estate demo application where our aim was to try and use simple technologies to demo a real estate with simple entities using authentication.
## We used spring boot, docker, kyma and cloud identity services to make this and made it accessible with APIs.

### Below are the API links for each entity:
